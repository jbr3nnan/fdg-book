#+title: Chapter 8: Curvature
#+STARTUP: noindent

If the intrinsic curvature of a manifold is not zero, a vector
paralleltransported around a small loop will end up different from the vector
that started. We saw the consequence of this before, on page 1 and on page 93.
The Riemann tensor encapsulates this idea.

The Riemann curvature operator is

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

The traditional Riemann tensor is[fn:1]

\begin{equation}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is a one-form field that measures the incremental
change in the vector field $\mathsf{u}$ caused by parallel-transporting it
around the loop defined by the vector fields $\mathsf{w}$ and $\mathsf{v}$.
$\mathsf{R}$ allows us to compute the /intrinsic curvature/ of a manifold at a
point.

The Riemann curvature is computed by

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((Riemann-curvature nabla) w v)
  (- (commutator (nabla w) (nabla v))
     (nabla (commutator w v))))
#+end_src

The =Riemann-curvature= procedure is parameterized by the relevant
covariant-derivative operator =nabla=, which implements $\nabla$. The =nabla= is
itself dependent on the connection, which provides the details of the local
geometry. The same =Riemann-curvature= procedure works for ordinary covariant
derivatives and for covariant derivatives over a map. Given two vector fields,
the result of =((Riemann-curvature nabla) w v)= is a procedure that takes a
vector field and produces a vector field so we can implement the Riemann tensor
as

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((Riemann nabla) omega u w v)
  (omega (((Riemann-curvature nabla) w v) u)))
#+end_src

So, for example,[fn:2]

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(((Riemann (covariant-derivative sphere-Cartan))
  dphi d/dtheta d/dphi d/dtheta)
 ((point S2-spherical) (up 'theta0 'phi0)))
;; 1
#+end_src

Here we have computed the Ï† component of the result of carrying a $\partial /
\partial \theta$ basis vector around the parallelogram defined by $\partial /
\partial \phi$ and $\partial / \partial \theta$. The result shows a net rotation
in the $\phi$ direction.

Most of the sixteen coefficients of the Riemann tensor for the sphere are zero.
The following are the nonzero coefficients:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathsf{R}\left(\mathsf{d}\theta, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \right) \
\left(\chi^{-1} \left(q^\theta, q^\phi \right) \right) &= \left(\sin \left(q^\theta \right) \right)^2, \\
\mathsf{R}\left(\mathsf{d}\theta, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \right) \
\left(\chi^{-1} \left(q^\theta, q^\phi \right) \right) &= -\left(\sin \left(q^\theta \right) \right)^2, \\
\mathsf{R}\left(\mathsf{d}\phi, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi} \right) \
\left(\chi^{-1} \left(q^\theta, q^\phi \right) \right) &= -1, \\
\mathsf{R}\left(\mathsf{d}\phi, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \right) \
\left(\chi^{-1} \left(q^\theta, q^\phi \right) \right) &= 1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

** Explicit Transport

   We will show that the result of the Riemann calculation of the change in a
   vector, as we traverse a loop, is what we get by explicitly calculating the
   transport. The coordinates of the vector to be transported are governed by
   the differential equations (see equation 7.72)

[fn:1] [11], [4], and [14] use our definition. [20] uses a different convention
for the order of arguments and a different sign. See Appendix C for a definition
of tensors.
