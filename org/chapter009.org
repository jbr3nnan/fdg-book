We often want to impose further structure on a manifold to allow us to define
lengths and angles. This is done by generalizing the idea of the Euclidean dot
product, which allows us to compute lengths of vectors and angles between
vectors in traditional vector algebra.

For vectors $\vec{u} = u^x\hat{x} + u^y\hat{y} + u^z\hat{z}$ and $\vec{v} =
v^x\hat{x} + v^y\hat{y} + v^z\hat{z}$ the dot product is $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}
= u^xv^x + u^yv^y + u^zv^z$. The generalization is to provide coefficients for
these terms and to include cross terms, consistent with the requirement that the
function of two vectors is symmetric. This symmetric, bilinear, real-valued
function of two vector fields is called a /metric field/.

For example, the natural metric on a sphere of radius $R$ is
